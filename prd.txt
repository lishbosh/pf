Cursor builds APK using Capacitor or Cordova

6. APK Build Requirements (Cursor Workflow)

Inside Cursor:

Step 1: Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init portfolio-app com.myportfolio.app

Step 2: Build Web App
npm run build

Step 3: Copy Files Into Android
npx cap add android
npx cap copy
npx cap open android

Step 4: Build APK Inside Android Studio

Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → APK

This creates a real Android APK for your app.
